## go-shorten: URL Shortener Service

This service stores and serves URL redirects.

### Can I use it in production?

I dunno? I will be at some time soon-ish.

### Why?

By itself, URL shortening is stupid useful. Want to visit a thing? Type "go/thing" into your browser and hit enter.

Things like this make everyone's life better.

## Credits

I forked this project from <https://github.com/didip/shawty> because I liked how they laid out their project but I wanted to add a bunch more features and productionize it a bit more than was within scope for the original project.
